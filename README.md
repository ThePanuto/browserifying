# Hello

I was wondering what an actual project might look like with browserify, and was looking to get intimate with Gulp. So here it is, one that uses both.
This is a *educational* project. That means it has no meaning. It's /dev/null. No use. No practical use, actually.

# Do Whatever The Fuck You Want License
Fork it, change it, repost it, whatever. The only thing I ask is that you __learn__ what you're reading.
Change, tweak, and if you feel proud about yourself, contact me and let me know. For real. I really want to know what you built with it.

# Special thanks
To myself. Who glued this
